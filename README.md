# Teams & SharePoint Access Model

## Overview
This repository documents a structured access and collaboration model for Microsoft Teams and SharePoint in a fully remote organization.  
It demonstrates how to securely onboard users, manage permissions, and maintain organized collaboration spaces while supporting rapid team scaling.

This model is designed for IT Support Specialists supporting distributed workforces using the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.
